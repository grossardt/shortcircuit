The submitted circuit was mainly ontained through a combination of sheer luck and bruteforce optimization.
We first observed that already a single Trotter step (i.e. approximating exp(-i(H1+H2+...+Hn)) by exp(-iH1)exp(-iH2)...exp(-iHn)) yields an error below the requirement if the n=276 operators are ordered by the magnitude of their coefficient (H1 with largest coefficient) - it feels like there must be some logic behind this, but in our case it was only aesthetic desire that lead us to arranging the operators by magnitude of the coefficient. We further noticed that the error stays below the limit if one neglect the 85 summands Hk with smallest coefficient.
After that we used COBYLA minimization to minimize the error with respect to the coefficients (one coefficient at a time, starting with the largest one). In the resulting Hamiltonian, a further 7 operators could be neglected without the error exceeding the limit.
After applying qiskit.transpile to the circuit implementing this product of 184 unitaries, the resulting circuit has a depth of 1380 and results in an error of 0.0975.
